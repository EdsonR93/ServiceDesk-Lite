# Contributing

## Workflow
- Create a branch: `feature/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`
- Open a PR early (draft is fine)
- Link issues in PR description using `Closes #123`

## Definitions
- **Epic**: Large work area that groups Stories
- **Story**: Small, implementable unit with acceptance criteria
- **Chore**: Non-feature work (refactor, config, cleanup)
- **Bug**: Fix for incorrect behavior

## Quality bar
- Keep changes small and reviewable
- Add/adjust tests for non-trivial logic
- Keep docs updated if behavior changes
